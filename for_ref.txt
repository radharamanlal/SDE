#demo1.py
The TEST_IMAGE_PATH = 'test_images/1.jpg' line points to a single file. 
The UPLOAD_IMG_NO = 5 variable just tells the upload_images function to loop 5 times, uploading that same file each time.

Why does it do this?
This is done on purpose to demonstrate the Performance (Scalability) quality attribute.
To have a "fair race" and prove that 3 filters are faster than 1, we must give them the exact same amount of work.

If you upload 5 different images, one might be 10MB and another might be 50KB. 
The total time would be unpredictable. By uploading the same 1MB image 5 times, we create a consistent workload and can scientifically measure the speedup.

#demo2.py
Here is the testing script for the second quality attribute: Availability (Fault Tolerance).

This script will run a live experiment to prove that your architecture is resilient.
It will start multiple, redundant filters, give them work, and then suddenly kill one of them (a "fault"). 
You will see that the remaining "spare" filter takes over and no work is lost, demonstrating the "Active Redundancy".
